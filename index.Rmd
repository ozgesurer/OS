Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences Department at Northwestern University. I have an M.S. degree from the Industrial Engineering Department at Bogazici University in Turkey, and a B.S. degree in the same field at Istanbul Technical University.

My research interests lie in applied statistical learning, in particular design of new interpretable predictive models and their interdisciplinary applications.
