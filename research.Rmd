**Coefficient tree regression for discovering structure in generalized linear models**

Massive regression data sets are now commonplace, with so many predictors that they cannot or should not all be included individually. In practice, derived predictors that are the sum of groups of individual predictors (which is equivalent to predictors within groups sharing the same coefficient) are often relevant. However, the groups of predictors are often not known in advance, and they must be discovered from the data. In this study, we extend our coefficient tree regression algorithm to generalized linear models to discover the group structure from the data.

**Discovering structure in longitudinal data via coefficient tree regression**

When the data have a spatial and/or temporal component, we often expect that predictor variables that are closer in space and/or time are more likely to be associated with the response in the same way. In such situations, we can exploit those aspects and discover groups of predictors that share the same coefficient according to their spatial and/or temporal proximity. In this study, we propose a new algorithm called coefficient tree regression for longitudinal data to understand the underlying spatial and/or temporal characteristics of the data.
